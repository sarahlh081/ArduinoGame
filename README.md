# ArduinoGame
This code consists of 2 arcade games designed for the arduino.

An led matrix, two joysticks, a breadboard, a button, an Arduino MEGA, and several wires (both male-to-male and male-to-female) were used.

The first game (game 1) is a pong game. Two opponents play against eachother with separate joysticks. When one player wins, a message
is displayed on screen.

The second game was named "Light-Dodger" (game2). Essentially, the player is one pixel and can move in any direction. The goal is to avoid a ball of light that bounces around the screen. The ball will grow in size and speed as the game goes on.

A .ino file called games.ino is uploaded to the arduino. If the button is pressed once, it calls the game1.cpp file. If it is pressed a second time, it calls the game2.cpp file. All files should be stored in the same folder.
